It is a simple beginner friendly php project. 
Its a landing page consisting of a form whose data is sent to database and programmer can use that data for further purposes.
I am going to add more features to it like form validation, and then i would like to add user login features so that i can get experience of doing these things in php as well.
Being proficient in MERN Stack also helps me to adapt with php easily.
